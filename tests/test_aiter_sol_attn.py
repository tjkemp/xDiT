"""Tests for the AITER Sol-Attn attention backends.

Sol-Attn (arXiv 2607.24027) runs an AITER MHA v4 mode-2 row over the KV blocks its routing selects
and recovers the rest from pooled per-block K/V under the same online softmax, so a dropped block
costs its higher-order terms rather than all of its mass.

Four rows are built -- fp8, i8fp8, mxfp8 and mxfp4 -- differing only in how Q/K/V are quantized.
Where a test is about the mechanism rather than one row's precision it is parametrized over all
four, because the MX rows reach the kernel by a different route: they have no raw entry point and
their block-granular scales do not survive pooling, so they pool in dequantized space and hand the
kernel a pooled scale of its own.

It differs from the Sparge backends in ways these tests pin down: it routes for itself instead of
through a Sparge block mask, it is gfx950-only, and it rejects ring parallelism outright because
merging partial outputs by LSE stops being valid once each rank has added its own correction.
