"""Sol-Attn: block-sparse fp8 attention with a pooled-KV correction for the blocks it skips.

Plain block-sparse attention routes each query tile to a subset of KV blocks and DROPS the rest.
Sol-Attn (arXiv 2607.24027) computes the same selected blocks exactly and additionally recovers the
contribution of the skipped blocks from pooled (mean) K/V, so the mass outside the selection is
approximated instead of discarded.

    query/key/value are (batch, nheads, seqlen, head_dim) bf16 tensors. They are permuted into the
    BSHD layout the kernel takes and handed to aiter's mha_v4 Sol-Attn row for `recipe`, which owns
    the Q/K Hadamard rotation, format validation and the ASM launch. See SOL_ATTN_RECIPES for the
    rows this build ships.

    return_head_cost asks for the per-head count of exactly-computed KV blocks, float32 (nheads_q,),
    which the Ulysses head balancer consumes. On a per-tensor recipe it is opt-in rather than free:
    the routing dict it reduces is internal to the raw entrypoint, so asking for it moves the call
    onto aiter's packed API and makes quantization and routing explicit here. The MX recipes have no
    raw entrypoint and take that path always. A caller-supplied `routing` also forces it. Every path
    is traceable; none graph-break.

    key_seqlen is the number of real KV tokens when the caller has already padded the sequence for
    its own alignment, as MiniMax-H3 does to pack one request into one audiovisual sequence. Sol-Attn
    takes no attention mask, so the padded tail is dropped here rather than attended: left in, it
    would draw softmax weight and also enter the routing threshold's per-tile mean and standard
    deviation, which is a quieter error than the weight itself. Defaults to the whole tensor.

    exact_tokens is a per-KV-token bool mask, (seqlen_k,), naming tokens that must be computed
    exactly rather than left to the pooled approximation. Routing still runs; these are added to
    what it picked. A caller whose sequence is one modality does not need this. A caller packing
    several into one sequence does: the threshold is built from statistics over every block, so a
    modality holding a small share of the sequence is judged against a distribution the majority
    wrote, and its own queries lose the blocks they needed. Flagging the minority costs about one
    exact block per block it occupies, which is few by the same token.

    sequence_permutation optionally reorders the shared Q/K/V sequence before routing, and
    sequence_inverse_permutation restores the query rows on return. This is used by MiniMax-H3 to
    make spatially adjacent video tokens share blocks while leaving its external packed-row
    contract unchanged.

    descales, a (q, k, v) triple of float32 per-tensor descales, says query/key/value are already
    fp8 codes, as fp8 comms sends them: Q/K Hadamard-rotated, V not. Only the fp8 recipe takes
    them, and nothing is quantized here. The rotation need not be aiter's own: any orthonormal
    one applied to both Q and K leaves the scores and the pooled block means unchanged. Routing
    runs on these same codes, so it sees exactly the K the kernel reads.
